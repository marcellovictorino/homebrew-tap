# Desk Check's Homebrew formula has one source: this file in the desk-check repository.
# The tap (marcellovictorino/homebrew-tap) copies it at each release tag and fills in its own
# url, sha256 and revision. In desk-check the url and checksum are placeholders; change install,
# test and caveats in desk-check, never in the tap.
# Desk Check is built on the person's own Mac during `brew install`, with Apple's
# command line tools. Built here, it is signed ad hoc for this Mac and opens without
# a macOS warning, so no Apple developer account is needed.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Start Desk Check with:
        desk-check
      It lives in the menu bar and has no Dock icon.
      After brew upgrade, run desk-check again: it quits the old version and opens the new one.

      To find it in Spotlight and Launchpad as well:
        ln -sf "#{opt_prefix}/DeskCheck.app" ~/Applications/
    EOS
  end

  test do
    system pkgshare/"verify-app.sh", prefix/"DeskCheck.app"
    assert_equal version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/desk-check --version").strip
  end
end
