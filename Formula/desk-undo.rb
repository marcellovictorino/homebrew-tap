# Desk Undo is built on the person's own Mac during `brew install`, with Apple's
# command line tools. Built here, it is signed ad hoc for this Mac and opens without
# a macOS warning, so no Apple developer account is needed.

      Start Desk Undo with:
        desk-undo
      It lives in the menu bar and has no Dock icon.

      To find it in Spotlight and Launchpad as well:
        ln -sf "#{opt_prefix}/DeskUndo.app" ~/Applications/
    EOS
  end

  test do
    system pkgshare/"verify-app.sh", prefix/"DeskUndo.app"
  end
end
